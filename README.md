Healthcare Diagnosis for Breast and Heart Diseases Using Machine Learning

This project leverages the power of machine learning algorithms to build predictive models for the diagnosis of breast cancer and heart diseases. The aim is to provide a reliable, efficient, and scalable solution for healthcare professionals to assist in early detection and improve patient outcomes.

Features
Breast Cancer Prediction: Implements machine learning models to classify tumors as malignant or benign based on clinical data.
Heart Disease Prediction: Builds predictive models to assess the risk of heart disease based on patient attributes.
Data Preprocessing: Utilizes robust preprocessing techniques to handle missing data, normalize features, and ensure model accuracy.
Model Evaluation: Employs metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC for rigorous performance evaluation.
Visualization: Provides detailed visualizations of data distributions, feature importance, and model results for better interpretability.

Technologies Used
Python: Primary programming language for data processing, model building, and visualization.
Machine Learning Libraries: Scikit-learn, TensorFlow, or PyTorch for model implementation and training.
Data Visualization Tools: Matplotlib, Seaborn for creating insightful visualizations.
Jupyter Notebook: For interactive development and experimentation.
